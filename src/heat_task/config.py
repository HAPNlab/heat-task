# command, plus one long-lived socket that polls temperature status in a loop.

#   POLL_INTERVAL_S   gap between status polls
#   CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S how long to wait for the initial connection
#   RECV_TIMEOUT_S    reply deadline for one-off commands
#   POLL_RECV_TIMEOUT_S reply deadline for the status poller's socket

# Min gap between status polls (~100 Hz). Caps load on MMS — hammering it at the
# raw link rate provokes dropped/late responses and floods the trace with
# near-duplicate rows — while staying well above the thermode's update rate.

# Backoff between failed reconnect attempts in the status poller. The common case
# is a single dropped poll that reconnects instantly, so we start small to keep
# that freeze short (a flat 1 s sleep here was the source of the rare ~1 s lag
